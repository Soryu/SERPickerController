# SERPickerController

A simple component to show any kinds of values in a UIPicker that slides in from the bottom.


You can pass an array of objects the picker should represent and a transformation block that knows how to make an `NSString` instance out of these objects. That string is then shown in the simple one-component picker. The picker can be presented “modally” in a view. It will block out access to the underlying view with a semi-transparent overlay.
